# CS330-OpenGL

Reflection on SNHU Computer Science course CS330 - Computational Graphics and Visualization


1. How do I approach designing software?
    What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    What design process did you follow for your project work?
    How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

This project, and course as a whole, has helped me with the process of slowly chipping away at code until I get the desired outcome. In the past, I have had a habit of trying to write and edit large blocks of code at once, without incremental testing. This course helped me realize how important it
is to write and edit code in smaller portions to make sure little changes I make here and there do not compound upon themselves. This mindset can, and will, be applied to my future programming endeavors. It will help me not get caught up in making too many changes at one time without testing my code as I go.


        
2. How do I approach developing programs?
    What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    How did iteration factor into your development?
    How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Similar to my answer for the first question, incremental development played a large role in my success throughout this course. Whether it was rotating a 3D object just fractions of a degree at a time, or shifting it along an axis, I had to carry out many iterations of this to reach my desired result. I really enjoyed the layout of this course with the milestones. Along with making many resources available and having me do small assignments each week pertaining to that information, there were also milestones within most weeks. These milestones allowed me to learn each process that would be necessary for me to create a functional and interactive 3D scene. This made the final project much less intimidating when it finally came time to submit it. 


   
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?   
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I am confident that the skills I learned throughout this course will make themselves apparent throughout my the remaining course in my degree. I am not sure which, if any, other courses with make use of OpenGL, but I know the iterative approach that I learned and used in this class will be very useful for me in upcoming courses. 
I am still unsure where I will find myself as far as a professional setting once I complete my Bachelor's degree. I think it would be very rewarding for me to land a job somewhere that I could develop with graphics and OpenGL. I wasn't sure how I would do in this course before it began, but I constantly found myself glued to the computer trying to get my 3D scene just right. Even if I don't end up in a role that has anything to do with graphics and design work, the iterative approach used in this class will no doubt help me in whichever career path I find myself in.
